        <p>
            By default, web forms send data in plain text. Yes, even that password field
            that looks like ••••••••. On an unencrypted connection (that is, without HTTPS),
            that data can be read by any computer along the route from you to the website,
            including your ISP. In some cases, it can even be read by other computers who are just
            connected to the same network as you.

            Submitting a form on a website with an <i>http://</i> connection and not <i>https://</i>
            is a little like sending a letter in the mail without an envelope.
